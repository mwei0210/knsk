# knsk - Kubernetes namespace killer

This tool is aimed to kill namespaces that are stuck in Terminating mode after you try to delete them. Just calling this script without flags, it shows you the possible problems that put your namespace in forever terminating mode.

It automates the tips by https://github.com/alvaroaleman in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/60807#issuecomment-524772920

If it doesn't work for you, please, let me know. It is hard to force namespace in Terminating mode just to test it.

### Do you want a backup first? 

Just call the script to make a backup of all cluster in YAML format, ordered by folder:

     curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thyarles/knsk/master/bakup-yaml.sh | bash 
     wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thyarles/knsk/master/bakup-yaml.sh -O - | bash 

### Basic usage
     curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thyarles/knsk/master/knsk.sh | bash 
     wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thyarles/knsk/master/knsk.sh -O - | bash 
     
In this mode, this script only shows the possible causes that put your namespaces in **Terminating** mode. If you want this script to try to fix the mess, clone this repository, set the execution bit to the `knsk.sh` script and look at advanced options by typing `./knsk.sh --help`.

Just to see what are the possible commands to solve the problem by yourself, use the advanced mode like

     ./knsk.sh --dry-run --delete-all --force
